# Consensus Multidimensional Scaling

![](../coMDS/man/figures/schematic.png)

Different dimension reduction methods often output different and possibly conflicting visualizations of the same data. 
This problem is further exacerbated by the choice of hyperparameters, which may substantially impact the resulting visualization.
To obtain a more robust and trustworthy dimension reduction output, we develop a multi-view framework called [Consensus Multidimensional Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15802) (CoMDS), which summarizes multiple dimension reduction visualizations (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) into a single *consensus* visualization.
This consensus visualization captures the common structure that is shared across different dimension reduction methods and hyperparameter settings. 
Such shared structure is likely more reliable than idiosyncratic structures, which are present in only one or a small subset of methods.
In addition to CoMDS, we provide a local variant of CoMDS, *Local Consensus Multidimensional Scaling (LoCoMDS)*, which further enhances robustness by preserving local consensus structures and decreasing the influence of outliers.

For more details, check out [An, B., Tang, T. M. "Consensus dimension reduction via multi-view learning." (2025).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15802)

## Project Structure

This directory contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures in [An and Tang (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15802).

To ensure reproducibility, we use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to create a reproducible R environment. To install the necessary dependencies and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `coMDS-manuscript.Rproj` in RStudio.
3.  Restore the project dependencies by running:

``` {r, eval =FALSE }
# install.packages("renv") # if not already installed
renv::restore()
```

4.  Download the datasets used in the manuscript from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17956327) and place them in the `coMDS-manuscript/data/` directory.
5.  Run the analysis and figure-generation scripts as needed (The main scripts are in the [scripts/](scripts/) directory and driver scripts are in the [job_scripts/](job_scripts/) directory).

These steps will generate all of the figures and results from the mansucript.
