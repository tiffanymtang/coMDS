Description: Consensus Multidimensional Scaling (CoMDS) provides a multi-view 
    framework to summarize multiple dimension reduction visualizations (e.g., 
    PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) into a single consensus visualization. This consensus 
    visualization captures the common structure that is shared across different 
    dimension reduction methods and hyperparameter settings. This package 
    provides tools to fit CoMDS and its local variant LoCoMDS, as detailed in
    An and Tang (2025).
